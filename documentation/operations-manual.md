# Travelcy Operations Manual

## Overview
Travelcy is a native android application developed in Kotlin with Android Studio.

## Coding conventions
We have been following Kotlins' standard coding convention, which can be found here https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html

## Testing
Tests are defined under seperate packages com.travelcy.travelcy (test) and com.travelcy.travelcy (androidTest), under which we define our tests, mocks of repositories/services etc.
Creating tests is a necessary part of our workflow, and it is taken into consideration when reviewing pull requests.

For running the tests in Android Studio - see this documentation https://developer.android.com/studio/test/#run_a_test 
For explanation on how the tests are run in our CI/CD pipeline, see the CI/CD section below.

## Setting up the development environment
1. Download and install Android Studio https://developer.android.com/studio/
2. Set up git on your machine if you haven't already and clone the repository from here https://github.com/Travelcy/Travelcy
3. You may have to download and install the most recent java sdk https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html

## Pull request/review policy
For every new feature or bug fix you should create a branch based on develop. When work is done you create a pull request in github and wait for it to be reviewed.

When reviewing a pull request, there are certain standards that need to be met. Are coding conventions being met, have relevant tests been created, does everything build and run accordingly, is there redundant code, are there obvious security flaws?

Pull request merging is blocked until the test run is successful and at least one reviewer has approved.

## CI/CD
Our CI/CD is configured with github actions and fastlane: https://github.com/Travelcy/Travelcy/actions
https://fastlane.tools/ 

Depending on the action - push to a branch based on develop, pull request from a branch to develop, etc.. a relevant workflow in github actions will run, currently we have 3 workflows: fastlane-production, fastlane-test and fastlane-beta. The beta and production workflows build the app and deploy it to the relevant destination, and the test workflow runs relevant tests and creates an artifact containing the result.

In more detail on how the workflows are triggered:
Creating a pull request from <branch_a> to develop or master will trigger fastlane-tests
Pushing or merging to develop will trigger fastlane-tests and fastlane-beta (runs only if fastlane-tests succeeds)
And finally pushing or merging to master from a branch triggers fastlane-tests and fastlane-production (runs only if fastlane-tests succeeds)

In more detail on what each workflow does:
fastlane-beta simply deploys the app to the play store for internal testing and bumps the version.
fastlane-production deploys the app to the play store for release and generates a user guide and operations manual, and also bumps the version.
As mentioned before both these workflows depend on fastlane-tests to be successful - this workflow generates an artifact containing the results from our tests. If a test fails you may in some cases want to re-run it, to do so navigate to the relevant test run from github-actions and re-run the test from there. Github actions also show you logs of what failed.

Our fastlane configuration can be found in the fastlane folder under the root of the project. The fastfile contains the steps each workflow takes.


## Bug reporting
For bug reporting we use bugsnag https://www.bugsnag.com , it reports unhandled exceptions, counts  along with useful details to ease the bugfixing process.
By logging in with Travelcys' credentials, you will have an overview of everything bugsnag reports from the app.

We configured bugsnag in Travelcy by following their documentation https://docs.bugsnag.com/platforms/android/

Under manifests/AndroidManifest.xml in the project folder, we configured the API Key necessary to communicate with our BugSnag space

In the MainApplication file, BugSnag is started in the overrided onCreate function

This gives the app all the default functionality of bugsnag for bug reports.

## Analytics
For analytics we use Firebase https://firebase.google.com/ , it gives us useful data on the demographic of our users, retention (do users only use the app for a certain period of time), etc.

## Ads
For ads we use Google Admob https://admob.google.com/home/
