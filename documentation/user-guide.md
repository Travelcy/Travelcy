Navigate to the Settings tab on the bottom of your screen and select the currencies you want to be available.

The exchange rate is updated automatically by default, but if you wish to turn off this feature you can do it from the "Settings" tab as well. Here you can update it manually by the push of a button.

You can also update your personal budget here, set it to whatever value you want to limit yourself to for the occasion.

## How to split bill
Navigate to the Split tab on the bottom of your screen, add the items from your bill and insert their name and cost - you can also add people to an item if you wish to split its cost with them, you can also add a tax percentage and tip (Tip is by value or percentage). When you are done you can clear the bill, if you make a mistake simply click on the item and make the change.

If you have set a budget (see the settings tab), you will see when you are over or under it in the total. In the image below, the user is within the budget he set for himself.
